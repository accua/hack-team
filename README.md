## Description

* _As a user, I'd like the option to visit an "About" page that explains what the club is, and what they do._
* _As a user, I'd like all data persisted in a database, so it's always there when I need it._
* _As a user, I'd like to filter the list of users by their particular role in the group_
* _As an administrator, I want to add new users to the club. (User authentication is not required)._
* _As an administrator, I want to edit user profiles, in case I make a mistake, or need to update their details._
